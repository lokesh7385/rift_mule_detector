# MuleWatch: Financial Crime Detection Engine 🕵️‍♂️💸

> **Live Application**: [https://rift-mule-detector.vercel.app](https://rift-mule-detector.vercel.app)

**MuleWatch** is a serverless financial forensics engine designed to detect complex money laundering networks (smurfing, cycles, and mule rings) in real-time. Built for the RIFT 2026 Challenge.

## 🧠 Detection Algorithms

The engine employs a multi-layered graph analysis approach:

### 1. Cycle Detection (The "Round Tripper")
*   **Logic**: Identifies closed loops of transactions (`A -> B -> C -> A`) often used to artificially inflate transaction volume or layer funds.
*   **Optimization**: Restricted to cycle lengths of 3 to 5 nodes to prioritize high-confidence rings and respect serverless timeouts.
*   **Scoring**: High impact on Risk Score (92.5%).

### 2. Fan-Out / Smurfing
*   **Logic**: Detects single accounts dispersing funds to multiple recipients within a short time window.
*   **Behavior**: Characteristic of "placement" or "layering" stages where a mule herder distributes illicit funds.

### 3. High-Volume / Payroll Mules
*   **Logic**: Flags accounts with excessive flow-through (High In/High Out) but low retention, mimicking shell company behavior.

### 4. Vercel Serverless Optimizations
*   **Sampling**: Caps analysis at 10,000 rows to prevent Memory OOM (128MB limit).
*   **Timeouts**: Enforces a strict 5-second limit on cycle detection algorithms (O(n!)) to prevent HTTP 504 errors.
*   **Streamlined**: Single-file architecture (`api/index.py`) to eliminate cold-start import overhead.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Deployment

*   **Backend**: Python 3.9+, Flask, NetworkX, Pandas, Numpy.
*   **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, TailwindCSS, Cytoscape.js.
*   **Deployment**: Vercel (Monorepo: Frontend @ Root, Backend @ `/api`).

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run Simulation**:
    ```bash
    python simulate_logic.py
    ```
    *Verifies the core detection logic against a synthetic dataset.*

3.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    vercel --prod
    ```
